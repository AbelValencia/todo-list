# Todo-list
## Description
In this project, I have created a web page that keeps track of your todos. This app will help you to better organize your day and responsibilities.

## How to Run
Just put the URL of this project on your browser! You will find an input element to add chores to the list. then, after finishing the chore you can delete it by clicking on it.

## Roadmap of future improvements
I am planning to add a functionality that allows us to mark each completed chore as a completed instead of deleting it.
